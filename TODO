- look into all the variations of magic bitboards
  - black magic is a nice table size reduction of 18% at the cost of one additional instruction
  - byte lookup massively reduces the table size (all tables fit into my l1 cache!!) at the cost of an additional lookup
  - sharing attacks halves the table size at the cost of one additional instruction
    - adding the shift as well reduces the size of the magic struct at the cost of an additional instruction
- Make most higher-level functions return a `Result`
- seldepth
- Test `MaybeUninit` for `Moves` and `Pv`
- Test `search_info.set_pv(pv)`, which copies each element, instead of copying the whole pv with `search_info.pv = pv`
