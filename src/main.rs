//! Crab, a UCI-compatible chess engine written in Rust.
//!
//! Accepted commands:
//! - `f`: find magics for the bishop and rook
//! - `go` with the options `wtime`, `btime`, `winc`, `binc`, `movestogo`,
//!   `depth`, `nodes`, `movetime` and `infinite`. There's also a special
//!   option `perft <depth>`, which overrides the regular search to run perft
//!   to `<depth>`.
//! - `isready`
//! - `p`: pretty-print the current board
//! - `position`
//! - `setoption`: see output of `uci` command for more detail
//! - `stop`
//! - `uci`
//! - `ucinewgame`
//! - `quit`
